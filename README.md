## Technology used:

- I used javascript, css , some Bootstrap and html.

## Approach:
The main approach to the game is to store X and O in an array. Check if same token(X or O) are 3 in same row to declare the winner.

## How I solved the winner:
I tracked the position of X and O in an array. When X or O is playing, I checked if it meets the requirement to win.
## Main features:
- Track win, lose, tie Counter.
- Use local Storage.
- Audio.

- A slightly dumb AI.
